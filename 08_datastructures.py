# You need an ordered list of names	                            list
# Youâ€™re returning (x, y) coordinates from a function	        tuple
# You need to store config options or key-value data	        dict
# You want to remove duplicates from a list	                    set
# You want to check if a word appears in a large collection 	set
# You want to map usernames to scores	                        dict

cars.pop(1)

# Sets
# A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
# Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.

# Loop through the set, and print the values:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for x in thisset:
  print(x) 

#Check if "banana" is present in the set:
print("banana" in thisset) 

# Add an item to a set, using the add() method:
thisset.add("orange")
print(thisset) 

# Add elements from tropical into thisset:
# note we can add any iterable to the set: Add Any Iterable
tropical = {"pineapple", "mango", "papaya"}
thisset.update(tropical) #{'orange', 'cherry', 'apple', 'papaya', 'mango', 'banana', 'pineapple'}
print("Update with any iterable to add to the list:",thisset) 

# Adding the same item twice will not raise an error, but neither will it add to the set
thisset.add("orange")
print("Add orange:",thisset) 

# But it will work if the item is not exactly the same value ( case sensitive)
thisset.add("Orange")
print("Add Orange:",thisset) 

# Remove "banana" by using the remove() method:
# Note: If the item to remove does not exist, remove() will raise an error.
thisset.remove("banana")
print("After remove banana:",thisset) 

# Remove "banana" by using the discard() method:
# Note: If the item to remove does not exist, discard() will NOT raise an error.
thisset.discard("banana")
print("After discard banana:",thisset) 

# Remove a random item by using the pop() method:
x = thisset.pop()   #x is the item you removed
print(x)
print(thisset) 

# The clear() method empties the set:
thisset.clear()
print(thisset) 

#The del keyword will delete the set completely:
del thisset
print(thisset)  # Raises a NameError:


# Join set1 and set2 into a new set: thsi also works with other iterables like lists or tuples, with dictionaries you'll only add the keys.

set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
